**Welcome!**

This is a series of Jupyter notebook to learn Google Earth Engine (GEE) with Python. The first part has been adopted from [Google Earth Engine Guides](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/) and the second one is a recompilation of different interesting reproducible examples. If you want to contribute to this **GEE Course**, do not doubt to keep in touch with us. All the material is released under the Apache 2.0 license.
